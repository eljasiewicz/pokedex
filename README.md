# pokedex
My attempt at making poke-/attackdex in SQL using publicly available data

Attackdex.csv contains all pokemon moves up to gen VIII
Pokemon.csv contains all pokemon up to gen V

Pokedex_1.sql is code to store attackdex.csv and pokemon.csv as 2 tables in a database
In the future I plan to include table with pokemon/attack references so you could see which pokemon has acces to which attacks and vice versa
